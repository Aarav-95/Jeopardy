# Simple Jeopardy Project
Jeopardy is a family game that many of us know and have played at least one in our lives. We see the game show every weekday on the television, so why not create a python program that can resemble a jeopardy game that you can play with your friends!

This program is a mini project that I have created to play the game of Jeopardy using the Tkinter package in Python. It allows you to choose the amount of teams you play with and adjust the UI accordingly, as well as a score table so you can keep count of the team's score as you are playing the game.
